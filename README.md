For dataset to work on generating spectogram from audio files, you can refer to the link in the data file inside dataset 
folder.

To create spectograms of all audio files, i have used an for loop which will take all files from folder containing the audio file.
(In my .py file, all files are stored in train/ASVspoof2017_V2_train folder).



To create the spectogram of only one file, remove the for loop and make appropiate changes in the plotstft function inside the for loop.
